# TODO Application using HTML, CSS and JS
<h1>My own version of Trello</h1>
<p> Here's my own version of Trello, which I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To run this application, simply download all the files in a folder and run the index.html file. There are 3-4 todos already present in the HTML document as an example, which can be removed as per the user's liking. I made this app while I was learning JavaScript. </p>
